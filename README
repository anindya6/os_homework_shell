This is the solution to HW1 for W4118 Operating Systems.

The shell supports the following built-ins:

- `history [-c or number]`
- `!!`
- `!/`
- `cd [dir]`
- `exit`



!! and !/ are string pattern replace operations similar to how bash does it.
Therefore they can be placed between commands or as in-between args.


Input is taken character by character, and is realloced when the input is too large, this
ensures that the input can be as long as required.


Ctrl-D exits the shell. As does `exit`.


Run make to generate w4118_sh.
