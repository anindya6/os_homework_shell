This is the solution to HW1 for W4118 Operating Systems.
The shell supports the following built-ins:
- history [-c or number]
- !!
- !/
- cd [dir]
- exit
All executables can be run using the path specified (relative or full).

!! and !/ are string pattern replace operations similar to how bash does it.
Therefore they can be placed between commands or as in-between args.

Input is taken character by character, and is realloced when the input is too large, this
ensures that the input can be as long as required.

Ctrl-D exits the shell. As does `exit`.

Run make to generate w4118_sh.
Run make clean to get rid of the binary.
